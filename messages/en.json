They are advanced, highly-intelligent beings wielding powerful technology that appears to average citizens like a kind of dark magic.|At the end of the First Galactic War, the Helldivers worked together to eradicate the Illuminate. We believed we were successful, and for nearly 100 years, we have lived in relative peace, holding the Terminid and Automaton threats at bay. Thanks to our continued recruitment and training of new Helldivers, we have held these two fronts with complete, unmitigated success.|But now the Illuminate have emerged seemingly out of nowhere. Even though we don’t know the true origin of the invasion, we have no choice now but to suppress three factions in the Galactic War.|The Illuminate are spreading through mind control, abducting citizens of weaker dedication to democratic ideals and brainwashing them for a dark purpose which is still yet unknown to us. These mind-controlled citizens have been twisted and corrupted into a menace we call The Voteless–Super Earth’s own people turned against the principles of Democracy and fair elections, losing their ability to vote entirely.|The intentions behind the Illuminate invasion are still unclear. Right now, they remain as smaller bands of insurgents, staging attacks, building mysterious structures, and abducting citizens before disappearing again.|It’s up to us to stop them from getting their totalitarian tentacles any deeper into Super Earth’s domain.|The Fight at Our Doorstep|Omens of Tyranny is bringing the fight into the streets, with new mission areas inside Super Earth’s many colonies.|Our colonies are being ravaged by these invaders, turning our once bright and sunny streets filled with smiling citizens into dark ruins, overrun by Voteless and Illuminate. Arm yourselves with your trusted tools of destruction and rid our colonies of this scum.|But it won’t be easy. Gone are the wide-open spaces that Helldivers are accustomed to fighting in. Cities mean closer quarters, dark alleys, and forked paths where one wrong turn means meeting a horde of Voteless to liberate. You’ll need your best and brightest squad to navigate them carefully.|Go Easy on the Gun, Chief|With all these new developments, there won't be time to take driver's ed. courses, Helldiver. A Fast Recon Vehicle “FRV” will now appear in the colonies, ready to plow through the Illuminate at high speed.|Keep following the Major Orders issued by Super Earth High Command and you will get the keys to your very own FRV–a brand new, top-of-the-line manual transmission reconnaissance and combat vehicle. The whole squad can ride together, and your passengers can even lean out of the windows to lay down some suppressive fire as you shift gears and speed to your next destination. Just one question left: Who's driving?|There’s more to discover yet, and we can’t wait to get you back into the fight.|The newest major update for HELLDIVERS 2, Omens of Tyranny, featuring the return of the Illuminate faction, is now live!

This extra-large poker will give you good range and pairs perfectly with the SH-51 Directional Shield stratagem.|We think you’re going to appreciate some stationary firepower–something you can call down into a city center to put a dent in those Illuminate Harvesters. The E/AT-12 Anti-Tank Emplacement will allow you to liberate even the most heavily armored of enemies using the most democratic of firepower.|But what if you’re facing down a horde of Voteless and the Anti-Tank just won’t take out enough of them at once? I know what I’m going to call down: the A/FLAM-40 Flame Sentry. A stationary, high-powered flamethrower turret. Be careful with this one, though, Helldiver–if the red ammo canister takes too much fire, the whole sentry will go up in flames, taking anyone nearby with it.|While you’re busy holding off the onslaught with the shield and lance, you can get some additional help from the new Armed Resupply Pods booster, which upgrades your resupply pods with a tiny top-mounted turret to fend off stragglers while you make your way to the ammo drop. Just remember to keep your head down on approach!|Turn yourself into an immovable object for the enemy with the SR-18 Roadblock heavy armor.

We have chosen our words carefully–perhaps they should have done the same. The 'This is Democracy' emote will show those squids that Super Earth will not be conquered.|There are also coordinating player cards for Rebar Resolve and Holder of the Yellow Line, as well a new set of urban camouflage patterns, Concrete Jungle, for your hellpods, shuttle, exosuit, and the brand new FRV which will be available soon! And like our previous Warbonds, we’re including plenty of Super Credits to unlock.|The citizens of Super Earth’s colonies will rest a little easier knowing you’re armed with the latest from the Ministry of Defense.

Based on your feedback, we feel we can improve how the Superstore currently works.|Right now, many of you feel the items are in rotation for too short a time, and that you sometimes miss out on that killer look you had your eyes on. At the same time, the more things we add to the store the longer it takes to come back into rotation.|As we’re not quite ready to roll out a full redesign, we’re going to temporarily test longer rotations with Killzone, which will stick around for 5 days per page instead (there will be two pages of items to explore).|After this, the page rotation will go back to its usual cadence and we will be asking for your feedback on our test. If you think this is too short, or you want us to look into bringing items back for longer periods, we’ll ask again in future surveys.|Have fun, turn back those Illuminate incursions and give ‘em hell, ‘divers!\",\"Small patch incoming from High Command|Overview|Crash fixes|ADS jitter fix|Miscellaneous fixes|Fixes|Crash Fixes and Soft-locks:|Fixed a crash caused by Illuminate ships despawning|Fixed some potential crashes when the player quits the game|Miscellaneous fixes|Fixed an issue with jitter when aiming through scopes|Fixed an issue with the STA-X3 W.A.S.P Launcher's targeting not properly working when using one owned by another player|Reduced disconnections in Illuminate missions\",\"Greetings Helldivers, Release Captain Carlberg speaking.|Today is patch day and as such we bring you the latest and greatest from The Ministry of Truth.|Without further ado feast your eyes on our latest changes and fixes.|Overview|Spray weapons gas effect duration|Emoting while flying or ragdolling|FRV camera and handling tweaks|AX/TX-13 “Guard Dog” Dog Breath rework|Balancing|Crash Fixes|Weapon Fixes|Stratagem Fixes|Balancing|General Changes|The duration of the gas status effect from spray weapons has been increased from 6 to 10 sec|Implemented a timer for the Illuminate dropship wreckages to despawn to prevent them from obstructing paths in the colonies|Helldiver|The Ministry of Humanity has added a clause to its Principles of Correct Posture for Safe Lifting, now allowing Helldivers to jog while carrying two-handed items such as barrels and SEAF Artillery Rounds|FRV|Helldivers have now also been authorized to deploy grenades and stratagems while leaning out from the FRV|Tuned FRV handling for a better driving experience when cornering|Sidearms|Starting magazines increased from 2 to 3|Spare magazines increased from 4 to 5|Stratagem Support Weapons|TX-41 Sterilizer|Removed the crosshair drift recoil|Decreased the camera climb recoil|The duration of the gas status effect from spray weapons has been increased from 6 to 10 sec|Armor Passives|After hearing player feedback, we have decided not to fix a bug with the Siege Ready Armor Passive which gives more ammo to all magazine-based weapons, instead of just primary weapons as described.

No matter what “it” is. All Helldivers share this same belief, and fanatical loyalty is expected from all citizens of Super Earth. But the Helldivers need to demonstrate their allegiance. They need to look like the democratic disciples they are inside, and the only way we know to properly show it off is with the gear from our next Warbond*: Servants of Freedom.|So what does true devotion to Democracy look like?|Hellbombs. It looks like Hellbombs. They really send a message: liberation is big, loud, and happening all around you. It gets the spirit of democracy soaring, and gets a lot of other things soaring, too, like buildings. Bile Titans. Automaton industrial sites. Now, imagine you’ve got that kind of freedom strapped to your back. That’s the B-100 Portable Hellbomb, a beacon of democratic truth in a convenient backpack format, which can be easily activated by you or a helpful teammate. Just be sure to drop the pack and clear the area once it's active, because the B-100’s got a 10 second countdown that can’t be canceled.|How do you make the Sickle do more? Overclock it and bring some heat. The LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle is pure agony meets ecstasy as it starts to burn the wielder as well as everything in its path. Shoot through the pain, Helldiver.|To help you spread liberty around, you could equip the GP-20 Ultimatum–a front-loading grenade pistol for your secondary slot. The Ultimatum packs a punch like a grenade launcher on steroids, designed for closer range use. But handle it with care, or you might accidentally liberate yourself along with the enemy.|There’s a new kind of throwable in Servants of Freedom, too. The G-50 Seeker is a small drone that follows you and explodes near enemies when detected. The Seeker can also target pinged enemies, like sending it on a little crusade.|The IE-3 Martyr and the IE-12 Righteous medium armors have robe and cloak-inspired details and come equipped with the Integrated Explosives passive, which gives every Helldiver protection against becoming Voteless: upon death, your corpse will detonate and take out the enemies around you. Nobody’s going to control your mind, soldier.|These armors also have helmets with stoic faces to stare down the onslaught without fear. Show no weakness, Helldiver. Then drape yourself in symbolic reminders of your enlistment oath by pairing these sets with the Fre Liberam and Per Democrasum capes.|For the full effect, you can also equip the Servant of Freedom player title and equip the Raise Weapon cheer and look like a real follower of democratic values.|Become one of Super Earth’s most faithful fighters and show the squad your fervor for Managed Democracy with the Servants of Freedom Warbond!\",\"Freedoms Greetings Helldivers, Release Captain Carlberg here with the latest and greatest from Super Earth. For this update we also have a special message from High Command.|Lets dive in|Overview|Hello everyone!|It’s been an “interesting” week with a patch that had a few unexpected slip-ups. After testing and balancing, the wrong versions of some files for our new Warbond items were shipped, which wasn’t part of the plan. Misaligned scopes also made an unwelcome return, albeit in a new form - some bugs really are persistent, aren’t they? (Silently stares off into the distance…)|So, we even double-checked the scale of the LAS-16 Sickle, just to be sure.|On to the key points for this patch:|The LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle was meant to start with light armor penetration and build up to medium as more heat built up, but it launched with medium armor penetration right away, even with zero heat.|The GP-31 Ultimatum also gained extra ammo from the previously-a-bug-but-now-a-feature Siege Ready armor passive and we feel that this specific combination is too strong.|We’re huge fans of big booms booming big (to quote our fabulous Design Director) so we didn’t want to make the weapon less satisfying to use - we still want it to bring democratic tears to your eyes every time you use it, like it does for us. However, we will be addressing how easy it is to access extra ammunition for it, ensuring it requires a bit more effort to use it to the full effect.|It’s not our intent to release Warbond items that need immediate balancing, and we understand that any changes we make can evoke strong feelings. We want to assure you that we’re actively listening to your feedback and, as with any of our previous updates, we’ll keep monitoring the situation closely. Your input is invaluable, so please continue to share your thoughts on these changes. We’re always open to making further adjustments if needed!|Balancing|Primary Weapons|LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle|We’ve rebalanced the weapon to make the risk/reward dynamic more impactful. The goal is to ensure it feels like a truly powerful weapon while properly balancing the self-damage mechanics to reflect its high-risk nature. In the current live version, we felt it lacked both the punch and the level of risk we wanted and we didn’t feel it really lived up to our intent.|OLD|0-25% heat: AP3 55 damage - Deals 0 damage/second to players|26-90% heat: AP3 55 damage - Deals 10 damage/second to players|+91% heat: AP3 55 damage - Deals 50 damage/second to players + fire status effect|NEW|0-25% heat: AP2 55 damage - Deals 0 damage/second to players|26-50% heat: AP3 55 damage - Deals 10 damage/second to players|51-90% heat: AP3 70 damage - Deals 20 damage/second to players|+91% heat: AP4 70 damage - Deals 50 damage/second to players + fire status effect|Magazines|Starting magazines increased from 1 to 2 Spare magazines increased from 2 to 3|Sidearms|GP-31 Ultimatum|We have seen a lot of mixed player feedback for this weapon and how certain players feel it trivializes some of the|harder content whilst others feel it plays just fine and is a great addition to the game. We have carefully opted for an approach where we’d like to reduce the ease of access to additional ammunition while maintaining the weapon’s core identity as a powerhouse. This means players will need to put in more effort and strategy to maximize its effectiveness at the cost of some armor and booster synergy for this specific weapon.|We will continue to monitor these changes so please keep providing us more feedback!|The GP-31 Ultimatum is no longer influenced by the Hellpod Optimization Booster or the Siege Ready armor passive|Fixes|Resolved Top Priority issues:|Fixed a bug where the scope aim-center was misaligned with the projectile's fire trajectory, affecting all weapons but most noticeable when aiming down sights (ADS)|Crash Fixes, Hangs and Soft-locks:|Fixed a rare crash that could occur when joining someone who is swapping weapons|Fixed a rare crash that could occur when hot joining a mission with the SEAF artillery objective present on the planet|Fixed a crash when subtitles were shown and the language was changed|Fixed a crash when shutting down the game while in a cutscene with the Democracy Space Station|Fixed a crash when changing language during a mission|Fixed a crash related to switching languages|Fixed a crash that could occur for other players after a player disconnects from the session|Fixed a crash caused by emoting right after dropping a support weapon|Weapons and Stratagems|Fixed an issue where you could accidentally arm the B-100 Portable Hellbomb backpack when entering the FRV|Miscellaneous Fixes|Fixed an issue with the level generation where some objective terminals could become non-interactable|Fixed an issue with the Integrated Explosives armor passive sometimes not triggering|may Liberty guide your aim Helldivers|Release Captain Carlberg out\",\"Release Captain Carlberg here with a small but important update|Overview|Due to a new crash discovered in yesterday's patch we are issuing all Helldivers a new update to amend this error.
